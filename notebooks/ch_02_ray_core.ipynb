One of the great things about the Ray API for Python programmers is that it feels very familiar, using concepts such as decorators, functions, and classes. The Ray API is designed to provide a universal programming interface for distributed computing, which is a challenging task, but I believe that Ray succeeds in this by providing abstractions that are easy to understand and use. The Ray engine handles the complicated work behind the scenes, allowing Ray to be used with existing Python libraries and systems."

    "Have you noticed the differences? To execute your Ray task remotely, you must use a `.remote()` call. When tasks are executed remotely, even on your local cluster, Ray does it asynchronously. The items in the object_references list in the previous code snippet do not directly contain the results. In fact, if you check the Python type of the first item using `type(object_references[0])`, you will see that it is actually an `ObjectRef`. These object references correspond to futures that you need to request the result of. This is what the call to `ray.get(...)` is for. Whenever you call remote on a Ray task, it will immediately return one or more object references. In reality, while we introduced `ray.put(...)` first, you should consider Ray tasks as the primary way of creating objects. In the following section, we will provide an example that links multiple tasks together and allows Ray to handle passing and resolving the objects between them."

    "One aspect that may have been noticed is that the retrieve definition involves directly accessing items from the database. While this works well on a local Ray cluster, it is important to consider how this would function on an actual cluster with multiple computers. In a Ray cluster, there is a head node with a driver process and multiple worker nodes with worker processes executing tasks. By default, Ray creates as many worker processes as there are CPU cores on the machine. However, in this scenario the database is defined on the driver only, but the worker processes need access to it to run the retrieve task. Fortunately, Ray has a simple solution for sharing objects between the driver and workers or between workers - using the put function to place the data into Ray's distributed object store. In the `retrieve_task` definition, we explicitly include a `db` argument, which will later be passed the `db_object_ref` object."

    "In a previous example, we used ray.get(object_references) to retrieve results. This call blocks the driver process until all results are available. While this may not be an issue if the program finishes in a short amount of time, it could cause problems if each database item takes several minutes to process. In this case, it would be more efficient to allow the driver process to perform other tasks while waiting for results, and to process results as they are completed rather than waiting for all items to be finished. Additionally, if one of the database items cannot be retrieved due to an issue like a deadlock in the database connection, the driver will hang indefinitely. To prevent this, it is a good idea to set reasonable timeouts using the wait function. For example, if we do not want to wait longer than ten times the longest data retrieval task, we can use the wait function to stop the task after that time has passed."

Both the map and reduce phases can be run on any Ray cluster and the data shuffling is also handled by Ray."
