The maze is set up as a 5x5 grid, with one of the 25 cells being the \"goal\" that the player, called the \"seeker,\" must reach. Instead of providing a pre-determined solution, we will use a reinforcement learning algorithm so that the seeker can learn how to find the goal through repeated simulations of the maze. The seeker will be rewarded for reaching the goal and the algorithm will track which decisions were successful and which were not.

    "Suppose we have a set of experiences from a few games. How can we effectively update the values in the `state_action_table` of our `Policy`? One way to do this is by considering a specific situation, such as being at position `(3,5)` and deciding to go right, which brings us to position `(4,5)` just one step away from the goal. In this case, continuing to go right would result in a reward of `1`, indicating that the current state `(3,5)` combined with the action of going right should have a high value. On the other hand, going left in the same situation does not lead to any reward, so the value of the state-action pair involving left movement should be low."

    "There are several ways to compare the knowledge of this value to the current state-action value, which is the value stored in the policy's state-action table for the given state and action. One option is to calculate a weighted sum of the old value and the expected value, using a formula such as `new_value = 0.9 * value + 0.1 * next_max`. The weights of `0.9` and `0.1` have been chosen to reflect the preference for keeping the old value, and the important factor is that the weights sum to 1. However, this approach does not take into account the important information from the reward, which should be given more trust than the projected `next_max` value. To account for this, it may be beneficial to discount the `next_max` value by 10%. The updated state-action value would then be calculated as follows:\n",

However, we now want to properly evaluate our trained policy over multiple games and see how it performs on average.

All we had to do to parallelize the training process was to use the `ray.remote` decorator on a class appropriately and then make the correct remote calls. It's helpful to have some experience to do this correctly, but it's worth noting how little time we spent considering distributed computing and how much time we were able to focus on the actual application code.
